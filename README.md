# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning.

In this project, the objective is to predict whether the person has Diabetes or not based on various features like Number of Pregnancies, Insulin Level, Age, BMI.

Diabetes Prediction is my weekend practice project. In this I used DecisionTreeClassifier  to trained model that is used to predict the positive or negative result. I used GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to find the optimal hyperparameters to increase the model performance.
